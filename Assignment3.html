        <h3>1.Explained: In criticism & lawsuit, debate over coding for kids</h4>

            <p>
                <b>(i) Why is warning to code a big deal</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                At the turn of this contury, when extremely affordable computers made the way into technical and
                engineering colleges across the country, India was able to produce a huge army of coders and
                programmer-essentially people who could create computer software. As computing devices have
                taken over every aspect of life, the need for good programmers and coders has been increasing
                relentlessly and calls to teach coding and programming to young students have got londer in recent years platforms
                and companies have started to claim that kids as young as those in elementary school must begin to leam
                coding
            </p>

            <h3>(ii) How did the call to start teaching code to children in elementary school come about?</h3>

            <p>
            Since the advent of computers and the arrival of computer coding as the next big thing leaders of technology
            companies around the world have pushed for coding to be included as a subject m middle or higher secondary
            school for students who may be interested to learn. In 2018, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates wrote ana biog
            post that everyone could benefit from learning the basics of computer science According to Gates, coding
            which he taught himself and fell in love with the age of 13 led him to ask questions about how to achieve
            tasks, and find answers to questions. The questions in teaches you to ask-How do you accomplisha tack? Can
            you find a pattern? What data do you need? are useful no matter where you go in life. Gates wrote.

            <h3>(iii) What do the critics of code learning at an early age say?
            </h3>

            <p>
                The primary contention agvenat leammg to code at a very young age that some age groups, which are being
            targeted by platforms, are being pushed into it even before they have mastered the mathematical and
            technological fundamentals A metaphor that is often used in that children are being made to ride a bicycle
            before they have even leant to walk. Software engineer Pradeep Poonia, 30, a vocal mitic who has become a
            prominent voice in the debate, says "There's a reason why in mathematics addition is taught first, then
            subtraction, then multiplication, and then division. It is necessary to learn several elements of
            mathematics and logical thinking before one can code. What many of the online platforms are doing these
            days) is iske someone teaching you to draw a car under the pretext of making you learn how to build a car
